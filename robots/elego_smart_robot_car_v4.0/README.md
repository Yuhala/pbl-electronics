### Re-Programming the Elego smart robot
- The aim of this readme is to provide a guide for those wishing to reprogram the Elego smart robot car.


### Setup
- Install Arduino IDE
```
sudo apt-get install arduino

```
- Or download the tar-ball, extract and run `sudo ./install`. 
- Copy the folders in `CopyMeFirst` folder to the `libraries` folder of your arduino installation. If you downloaded the tar-ball, the `libraries` folder is a subfolder of the parent folder.
- If you need serial port permissions in Linux, fix as explained here: [fix serial port permissions](https://linoxide.com/how-to-install-arduino-ide-on-ubuntu-20-04/).
