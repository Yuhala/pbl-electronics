## Gas leak and smoke detection system
Accidental gas leaks or fires pose very large threats to property, the environment and human life. Many industrial facilities as well as homes, comprise technological setups to detect gas leaks and fires, and transmit useful notifications like alarms, automatic SMS/calls, etc. This project aims to build a simple prototype gas leak/smoke detection system based on the Arduino MC. Gas, smoke, and temperature sensors are used to detect any accidental gas leaks or fire, and trigger necessary alarms e.g SMS calls, LED flashes, or buzzers.
