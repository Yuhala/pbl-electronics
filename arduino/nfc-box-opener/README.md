## Saftey box opener with NFC reader.
NFC (Near Field Communication) technology enables wireless communication between two NFC-compliant devices, typically called the reader and the tag.The NFC reader generates an electromagnetic field which activates a circuit in the NFC tag. This allows the tag to send information, i.e the unique identifier of the tag, to the reader. NFC technology is widely used in wireless/contactless payment systems, identification badges, theft control for expensive products, etc.
In this project, we build a safety box which can only be opened with a specific authorized badge/card. The box is equipped with an NFC reader + Arduino MC system which tests the tags of the cards used. Any unauthorized card trying to open our safety box triggers an alarm.
