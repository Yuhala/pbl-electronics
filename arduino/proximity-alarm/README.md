## Proximity sensor
Proximity sensors are used to detect nearby objects without coming into physical contact. Detection of target objects is usually based on sound, IR, electromagnetic fields, etc. Proximity sensors are used in surveillance, automatic doors, radar systems, object
detection (e.g in car parking), speed detection, etc. In this project we design and build a prototype system to mimic object detection in car
parking systems. An ultrasonic sensor is used to detect how close an object (e.g someoneâ€™s hand) is to the sensor. As the object comes closer, a buzzer sound + lights indicates how close the object is: e.g yellow + buzzer sound = close , and red + more frequent buzzer sound = object very close.
