## Weather station
A weather station consists of instruments and equipment (e.g temperature and humidity sensors) for monitoring atmospheric conditions. Weather stations provide information used for weather forecasts as well as scientific research. In this project we design and build a prototype weather station capable of monitoring
atmospheric temperature, humidity, etc. Sensors are used to obtain data which is sent to an Arduino microcontroller for processing. The results from the Arduino are then displayed on an LCD display. Additional functionality like a buzzer alarm system could be added to provide notifications when the temperature rises above a certain level.
